# `webgis-angular` â€” the seed for webgis-AngularJS apps

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [webgis-AngularJS][webgis-angularjs] web app. You can use it
to quickly bootstrap your webgis-angular webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.

The seed contains a sample webgis-AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the webgis-Angular
framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `webgis-angular` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `webgis-angular` repository. You can get git from [here][git].

We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test `webgis-angular`. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].

### Clone `webgis-angular`

Clone the `webgis-angular` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/canyi1942/webgis-angular.git
cd webgis-angular
```

If you just want to start a new project without the `webgis-angular` commit history then you can do:

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/canyi1942/webgis-angular.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.
